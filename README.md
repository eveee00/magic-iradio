I hate that it ended so soon, I genuinely had more planned. oh well. I'll still try to dump the firmware as the M6 module itself should be functional.

this repo is still wip, but i have moved everything to the [wiki](https://github.com/eveee00/magic-iradio/wiki).<br>
<sub>yes, this wont stay on github wiki forever</sub>

## More info *I will move these things later*
